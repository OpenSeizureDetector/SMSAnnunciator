Android App to Generate Alarms when an OpenSeizureDetector SMS Alert Is Received

The [OpenSeizureDetector epileptic seizure detector app](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/Android_Pebble_SD) can generate SMS alerts to warn carers
if a user suffers a seizure.  Unfortunately the notification sounds on
phones for SMS messages arriving tend to be short sounds which do not repeat
so are easily missed.   This app addresses that shortfall by making 
continuous alarm sounds when a seizure detector alert is received.

Starting the App creates a background service which listens for SMS messages
arriving.
When a message arrives, it checks to see if it contains the characters "1651f3"
(which is the last 6 characters of an OpenSeizureDetector UUID).
If it does not contain those characters, the message is ignored.
If the characters occurr within the message (SMS messages generated by
OpenSeizureDetector V3.5.0 and higher do contain them), a continuous
sequence of alarm beeps is geneated and an activity is displayed on the phone
showing the received message, the sending number and presenting an 'Accept
Alarm' button.
Pressing the Accept Alarm button silences the beeping.
